    <p>Here's some information about my personal life.</p>
    <div><p>I am currently a final-year Electrical and Computer Engineering Student at the University of Texas at Austin. I enjoy learning about Software Engineering and Machine Learning!</p></div>
        <div><p>But it all started when I was born in the bay area (GO WARRIORS!) in 2001. I moved to Plano, Texas when I was 5 and lived in Plano for 4 years.</p></div>
        <div><p>Then I moved to India to live with my grandparents for 4 years til I was 13. Then I moved back to Frisco, Texas where I went to Fowler Middle School and after that to Frisco Liberty High School where graduated in 2019.</p></div>
        <div><p>Afterwards, I began attending the University of Texas at Austin.</p></div>
        <div><p>In my free time, I enjoy taking pictures of my friends, family and anything I find unique or inspiring.</p></div>

    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <h3>ERCOT - IT Solutions Architecture Intern (May 2022 - August 2022)</h3>
    <div>
        <p>I created a data collection notebook that automated the Cost Transfer data collection process using mainly Pandas and Python, Javascript, and SQL, saving ERCOT 20 hours monthly.
            In September, ERCOT deployed my project and now Solutions Architecture team at ERCOT spends less time monthly creating the report and instead they simply review it and send it to their superiors, saving them time and energy that they can put to use elsewhere.
            Overall this project was super useful in that it taught me to apply my data science skills that I learned in class and apply them to solve a real-life solution in an agile workplace environment. At the same time, my experience at ERCOT taught me how to work to meet exactly the requirements of the customer.</p>
